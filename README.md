# Random Quote Machine
This project was made to beat [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com)'s challenge "Build a Random Quote Machine".

A random quote machine would be a single page where the user clicks on a button an receive a quote from a famous person. The rules for the challenge follow below:

1. **Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/.
2. **Rule #1:** Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
3. **Rule #2:** Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
 * **User Story:** I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
 * **User Story:** I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

The code of this repository can be seen fully operational on [my Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/paullus/full/mVzWLx/)
